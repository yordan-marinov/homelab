# Homelab Documentation Index

Welcome to the documentation hub for my **enterprise-grade homelab project**.
This space acts as a **curated showcase** of architecture decisions, infrastructure layouts, automation, and operations — reflecting real-world production practices applied in a personal environment.

This index provides an entry point into the structure, goals, and growing body of documentation.

## 📘 Overview

- **Purpose:** Hands-on learning, experimentation, and demonstration of DevOps, SRE, and cloud-native skills.
- **Focus:** Infrastructure design, automation, observability, networking, security, and platform engineering.
- **Philosophy:** Build with production standards, learn with freedom.
